    <h4><b>Shreya</b></h4> 
    <p>Our hosts were so lovely, kind and helpful. We were welcomed with a glass of passion fruit juice made with fruit from their tree, which was very special.
      We had 2 rooms - the one upstairs was very spacious , the downstairs room was smaller but still plenty big enough with a desk. 
      Very comfortable beds and in a quiet location- best night’s sleep of the holiday!
      Quiet efficient air con.
      Our hosts prepared us a very tasty breakfast which was delicious.
      Our hosts let us leave our luggage for a few hours. Thank you! 
      Close to the terminal to take a houseboat tour - 750m. Also 10 minutes walk to town.</p>
